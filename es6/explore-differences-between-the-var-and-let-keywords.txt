/* 
Strict Mode is a reduced and safer feature set of JavaScript

Strict mode makes several changes to normal JavaScript semantics:
-Strict mode eliminates some JavaScript silent errors by changing them to throw errors.
-Strict mode fixes mistakes that make it difficult for JavaScript engines to perform optimizations: strict mode code can sometimes be made to run faster than identical code that’s not strict mode.
-Strict mode prohibits some syntax likely to be defined in future versions of ECMAScript.
-It prevents, or throws errors, when relatively “unsafe” actions are taken (such as gaining access to the global object).
-Strict mode makes it easier to write “secure” JavaScript.

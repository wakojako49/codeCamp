//One key difference between the spread operator and array destructuring is that the 
//spread operator unpacks all contents of an array into a comma-separated list. 
//Consequently, you cannot pick or choose which elements you want to assign to 
//variables.

let a = 8, b = 6;
// Only change code below this line
[a, b] = [b, a];
